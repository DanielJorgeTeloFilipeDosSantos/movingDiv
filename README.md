A javascript algorithm that moves divs in a html page 

So you click the div, move it with the mouse, and click again to drop it where you want on the web page.

This can be used in a webbar, taking out the y and leaving the pageX coordenate, when it reaches a certain point,
it can trigger a function.

(click) a -----(onmousemove) div ----- > b (click)
